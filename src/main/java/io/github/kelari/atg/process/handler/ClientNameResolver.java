 * A utility class responsible for resolving the client name based on the configuration of the {@link CaseTest}.

 * based on whether logging is enabled or if a response timeout is configured for the test case.</p>
 *
 * <p>If logging is enabled or a non-zero response timeout is specified, the client name is resolved to "client".
 * Otherwise, it resolves to "webTestClient". This is important for determining which client instance
 * will be used during test execution.</p>
